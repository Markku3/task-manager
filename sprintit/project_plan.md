# Project Plan: Simple Task Manager

## Project Description

A web application that lets users add, view, and delete tasks. It stores tasks locally in the browser.

## Main Features

- Add task (with title and description)
- View all tasks
- Delete task

## “Customer” Needs (Simulated)

- The customer wants to keep track of daily tasks.
- Tasks should have a name/title and a short description.
- The customer wants to be able to add and remove tasks easily.

## Technical Choices (Explained Simply)

- **Frontend:** Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript for easiest setup.
- **Backend:** None (for simplicity, all data is stored in the browser).
- **Data Storage:** localStorage (saves data in the browser, no server needed).
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub.

## Feature Priority

| Priority | Feature                |
|----------|------------------------|
| 1        | Add/View/Delete Tasks  |
| 2        | (Optional) Edit Tasks  |
| 3        | (Optional) Mark Done   |
| 4        | (Optional) Due Dates   |

## Task Distribution

Since I'm working alone, I will handle all tasks, but I will document my process and decisions as if I were working in a team.

## Schedule

- Day 1: Planning and setup
- Day 2: Basic features (add/view/delete)
- Day 3: Testing, code comments, and documentation
- Day 4: Final review and reflection

## Reflection & Review

At the end of the project, I will review my code and write a reflection about what I learned and how I would work in a team for a similar project.
